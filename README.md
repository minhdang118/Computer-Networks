*socket-programming*: A client-server program in C that uses TCP to generate a game of rock paper scissors. Both players are prompted to input their move and one can wait for the other player if they have not made a move. The game ends in a dramatic drum roll and reveals the winner.

*routing-table*: Two programs implementing Link State Algorithm and Distance Vector Algorithm to find the shortest path between two routers in a network. The Link State Algorithm uses Dijkstra's algorithm, and the Distance Vector Algorithm uses Bellman-Ford equation. Both programs are written in C.
