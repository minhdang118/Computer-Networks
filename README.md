# Computer-Networks

Projects on Computer Networks written in C and C++.

*socket-programming*: A client-server program in C that uses TCP to generate a game of rock paper scissors. Both players are prompted to input their move and one can wait for the other player if they have not made a move. The game ends in a dramatic drum roll and reveals the winner.

*routing-algorithms*: Two programs implementing Link State Algorithm and Distance Vector Algorithm to find the shortest path between two routers in a network. The Link State Algorithm uses Dijkstra's algorithm, and the Distance Vector Algorithm uses Bellman-Ford equation. Both programs are written in C.

*secret-handshake*: A C++ program demonstrating RSA encryption and decryption. The program asks for the numbers n, e, d, and m. The program then encrypts m using n and e, and decrypts the encrypted message using n and d. The program also prints out the original message, the encrypted message, and the decrypted message.
